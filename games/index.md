## Games

### [Magic Squares](/games/bcc-magic)

A simple puzzle game from an old programming book I used to have.

### [Floor Is Lava](/games/unity-first-homework)

A simple Unity WebGL project. The goal was to build something where the ball
wouldn't fall. Rather than a more complicated layout, I went with finding the
boundaries of where I could get it close to dropping without actually
dropping.
